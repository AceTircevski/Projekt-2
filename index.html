<h1 class= "title cursive capitalize">The history of AC Milan</h1>
</header>
 <h2 class="destination">1.AC Milan</h2>
 <div class="description"> The first headquarters were established at the Fiaschetteria
   Toscana in via Berchet in Milan, back in 1899. From that moment on, glorious history of
   Milan started as the club wrote its in footballs record books becoming one of the most
   famous and succesful teams in the World, especially over the last 15 years.
   Rossoneri’s history is studded with the legendary names of those men who have made a
   major contribution to the club's development: presidents, coaches or players. The first
   president was a British expatriate, Alfred Edwards, who oversaw the club's first winning of
   the national championship - only two years after its foundation. The president with the
   highest number of trophies won is Silvio Berlusconi who has taken Milan to the pinnacle of
   the world since taking control in 1986. Extremely prestigious wins, obtained in every part of
   the world prove the unparalleled strength and organization of a great group.

   A top club stands out thanks to its the strategies and to its leaders, among whom the
   coaches play a decisive role; the story of AC Milan's successes is also linked to its coaches.
   The greatest Italian bosses trained the teams, from Gipo Viani, Nereo Rocco and Nils
   Liedholm, the masters of the Sixties, from whom Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello took the
   reins, basing their tactical and strategic philosophy on a modern, brilliant and spectacular football.</div>

   <p>In the years of Berlusconi’s management, Sacchi and Capello won and triumphed, giving wonderful emotions
     With Sacchi, Milan won in four national championships, two European Cups,
     two European Super Cups and two consecutive Intercontinental Cups;
     with Capello, four championships, a European Super Cup and a European Cup, in five seasons.
     In the most recent years, Alberto Zaccheroni kept the rich tradition going as he led the team
     to the win of a national championship in his first year before Fatih Terim took over
      for a short time and then passed the reins on to Carlo Ancelotti: a very welcomed
      return of one of the "invincibles" in Rossoneri’s big family.
       In 2009/10 season, Leonardo took over from the top-winner Mister Ancelotti,
        for one year, after 13 years spent in Milan’s family, first as a player, then as a manager.

        After Leonardo, Massimiliano Allegri led an all-star team in 2010/2011 season, thanks also
        to the new signings: Ibrahimovic, Robinho in August 2010 and Cassano, Van Bommel and
        Emanuelson in January 2011. With these champions reinforcing the squad, Allegri and
        Milan won the 18th Scudetto title and the 6th Italian Super Cup.
        After two and a half seasons which included a Serie A runners-up spot and a third-place
        finish, Massimiliano Allegri was replaced by Clarence Seedorf as AC Milan coach in
        January 2014, with the former midfielder leading the team until the end of 2013/14 season
        to the sixth place of the ranking.
        Filippo Inzaghi, who had already written his name in AC Milan’s history as a player and
        then as coach of the youth team, takes charge of the first team for 2014/15 season. Season
        2015/2016 starts under the management of Sinisa Mihajlovic - who leads the team to
        Coppa Italia final - and ends with Cristian Brocchi, promoted from AC Milan’s Primavera.
        Vincenzo Montella is AC Milan’s s coach for season 2016/2017 and the Rossoneri win the
        Supercoppa Italiana against Juventus, in Doha. From 27 November 2017 the new coach is
        Gennaro Gattuso, promoted from Milan’s Primavera. Gattuso has had an outstanding and
        winning career with Milan as a player (1999-2012).</p>
